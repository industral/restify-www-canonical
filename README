# Restify WWW Canonicalization


Restify middleware helps with SEO canonicalization, e.g. redirect from one domain to another, e.i. from `www.example.com` => `example.com`.
That's need to have only one entry point.


# Installation


```
npm install restify-www-canonical
```


## How to use


```
var wwwCanonicalization = required('restify-www-canonical');

server.use(wwwCanonical({
    // your params goes here
}));
```

Please see tests for all cases.
